Initially it was a conference badge creator based on SVG templates (https://github.com/PythonSanSebastian/pydger), but we thought
it could be more generic and have many other applications.

DocStamp is a generic template renderer which takes the data from a .CSV file or a Google Spreadsheet and creates
one rendered template file for each row of the data.

It needs Inkscape for .SVG templates and PDFLateX or XeLateX for LateX templates.

Usage
-----

The CSV header fields must match the ones in the template file.::

    docstamp -i registrations.csv -t my_template.svg -f name -f surname -o out_folder -n talk_certificate --idx 10

------------
